## Demo 

A live demo can be found [here](https://hike-ireland-project.herokuapp.com/)

## UX 

### Strategy 

Hike Ireland - is as per the name a website with informaiton on Hikes around Ireland. It's a 
website that allows hikers, walkers, ramblers and everyone else in between to come together and 
share details on the wonderful hikes in Ireland. 

This website is for everyone that is looking for a simple, easy to 
understand and easy to navigate website with details on hikes in Ireland. This is achieved by 
having a simple, clear funcitonal easy to understand website. Visitors will want to come back 
time and time again to gather information, provide information and learn more about hikes all over Ireland. 

### User Stories 

#### Visitor Goals 

* As a visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site. 
* As a visitor, I want the site to be simple to navigate.
* As a visitor, I want to quickly find information about hikes. 
* As a visitor, I want register an account so that I can add, update, edit and delete information I have provided.  
* As a visitor, I want the site to be visually appealing.
* As a visitor, I want the sire to be accessible and responsive on all devices. 

#### Site owner goals

* As a site owner, I want this site to be responsive so that visitors can have a good experience on all devices. 
* As a site owner, I want visitors to find this site visually appealing.  
* As a site owner, I want visitors to enjoy and interact with the site.
* As a site owner, I want visitors to return to the site and provide information on hikes. 
* As a site owner, I want to create a community where hikers come together and share information. 

### Scope

* For users, the site owner wanted to create a website that acts as a one stop shop for details on 
hikes around the Country, currently there are no such sites where hikers, walkers etc can gather required information 
all in one place. 

### Structure 

* In order to meet the expectation of "Hike Ireland" users,  the website aims to stick to convention 
in its layout and architecture.

* There is a header  and footer section on each page, with a "Hike Ireland" heading. Clicking on this
 heading will take the user back to the landing page of the website and this is, as mentioned above, 
an expected and understood convention. 

* There is a Log In / Registration Feature which enabes users to create an account and create, update, edit and delete
hiking posts. 

* All elements of the website are easily discoverable and aim to ensure that the user can get to their desired destination within 
3 clicks. 

* The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent.

* The website is interactive and provides lots of feedback to the user. 

* The architecture of this website has been carefully considered with the user in mind and allows for ease of movement through the content. 

* Information on this section has been inspired by the information on [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopment)

### Skeleton 

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com)

Please find full PDF versions of wireframes and sketches below:

* [Mobile Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/hike_ireland/blob/main/static/assets/wireframes/HIKE%20IRELAND%20-%20MOBILE.pdf)
* [Tablet Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/hike_ireland/blob/main/static/assets/wireframes/HIKE%20IRELAND%20-%20TABLET.pdf)
* [Desktop Wireframe](https://github.com/MWatty/hike_ireland/blob/main/static/assets/wireframes/HIKE%20IRELAND%20-%20DESKTOP.pdf)

### Surface 

#### Design 

 * The overall design of the website is  simple. The site owner wants the user to simply navigate and 
understand what is on offer without being inundated with information. Clear text and imagery are used to achieve this. 

#### Colour 

* A palette of Blacks, Greens, Greys and Whites are used throughout. The use of such colours is to relfect the green in the land and 
also to allow the imagery of the hikes to take centre stage. 

* When choosing the colours the [Colour Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) was used to assist.

#### Typography

* Mukta was chosen as this is a simple and unfussy font which will be clear and easy to read. 
This was chosen using [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* font-family: 'Mukta', sans-serif;

#### Images 

* All images used throughout the website have been carefully chosen to ensure the theme of the website is maintained throughout. 
Of course, users can upload their own images when adding posts which may lead to some differences in overall styling.

### Run the App 
1. Open your terminal window in your IDE
2. Type in **python3 app.py** to run the app

### Heroku Deployment
1. Create a Heroku account
2. Create a new app and select your region
3. In the terminal window of your local IDE type **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt** to create a requirements.txt file. This file is needed so that Heroku knows which files needs to be installed
5. In the terminal window of your local IDE type **python app.py > Procfile** to create a Procfile. This file is needed so that Heroku knows which file is needed as its entry point to get the app up and running
6. In the terminal window of your local IDE type in **heroku login** or **heroku login -i** and fill in your heroku credentials and password
